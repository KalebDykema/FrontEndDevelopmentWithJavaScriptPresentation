# Front End Development With JavaScript Presentation

This repository was made as part of a presentation going over a basic roadmap and entry guide to getting started in front end development. [This event](https://www.meetup.com/franklindevs/events/291671064/) occured on March 14, 2023, in Franklin, Tennessee as part of the [Franklin Developer Lunch & Learn](https://www.meetup.com/franklindevs/) group.

This is meant to serve as an example of the same site built using various technologies to incrementally add more on top of the previous version. All the sites are detailed below.

- HTML: This is just a barebones site with only HTML, which is used to lay out the structure of a webpage. There's no styling or functionality, so it's essentially just the "skeleton" of a site.
- CSS: This adds in CSS to the HTML site, which is a language used to add "styles" to a site and make it look pretty. This adds "muscles" to our site, but it still lacks functionality we could get from something like JavaScript. The newsletter sign-up portion is a good example of this, as it does nothing in the CSS site.
